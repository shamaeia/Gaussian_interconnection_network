Gaussian_interconnection_network
================================

This program can draw a Gaussian network, a Honeycomb network, or 
the difference between their distance distributions. 
These networks can be drawn in two different representation:
Diamond and Square.

The main file of this project is DrawGaussianNetwork.java
 
The numbers shown on each node represent the distance of a 
given node to the origin. 
 
The program takes two integers as a and b. These two integers
are the parameters of a Gaussian network generated by the
complex number a+bi. 

Assumptions: a and b are two (small) positive integers and a <= b
